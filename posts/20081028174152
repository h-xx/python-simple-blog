Syntax Highligting with Gist
Github (<a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a>), the new-ish Git repository hosting / social coding / collaboration site, launched a service called Gist a few days ago.  The developers describe it as a way to have cut/paste snippets of code and text in an easy-to-use git repository.  However, as soon as I saw the embed feature, I realized this was a perfect way to post code snippets in my blog.  I may still eventually develop my own syntax highlighting, but this will certainly suffice in the meantime.

Github is also an excellent complement to git, especially for git newbies.
